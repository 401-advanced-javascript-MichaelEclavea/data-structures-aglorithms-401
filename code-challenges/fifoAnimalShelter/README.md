Animal Stacks and Queues

I created stacks and queues, which then were run through tests to determine if they were working.


## Challenge

- take in either cat or dog.
- enqueue either cat or dog and create a new stack.
- if the input value was not cat or dog, then return an exception

## Approach and Efficiency

approach was to create the scaffold for a normal stack and then created the methods they use.Ran them through tests and verified they were working
