# Graphs
Graphs are just another connection of datatypes. It is representational of a linked list. Tho it contains keys and connections to other specified nodes. 

## Challenge
Node can be successfully added to the graph
An edge can be successfully added to the graph
A collection of all nodes can be properly retrieved from the graph
All appropriate neighbors can be retrieved from the graph
Neighbors are returned with the weight between nodes included
The proper size is returned, representing the number of nodes in the graph
A graph with only one node and edge can be properly returned
An empty graph properly returns null

## Approach & Efficiency
My Approach was to build the scaffold of a class method. 
addNode places a node into the graph along with a empty array attached. 
I also added a numberOfNodes to
