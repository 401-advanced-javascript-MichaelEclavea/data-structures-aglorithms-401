# Merge Sort

# Challenge Summary
- In order to divide the array in half, we need to figure out the middle.
take array and divide by 2. 

- This is where we will be dividing the array into left and right.
slice the first index to mid. 
slice the mid, which will equal the right side. 

- Using recursion to combine the left and right
merge left and right arrays into one. 

## Challenge Description

- take in an array.
- divide the array from left and right.
- sort the array comparing left and right. 
- return sorted array

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to follow the logic on the psedocode. This was extremely difficult to follow the psedocodes logic. So my approach was to follow the scaffold and step through step by step.
