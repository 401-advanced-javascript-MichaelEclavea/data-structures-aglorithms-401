# CHALLENGE SUMMARY
This challenge is open to solutions in which it will take in a string and return a boolean depending if the brackets close properly. () {} []

## CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:
## APPROACH AND EFFICIENCY 
my approach was to take in a string.
then create two arrays.
iterate through the string and push into arrays depending if the brackets were opening or closing. 

## SOLUTION

this solution of arrays worked! I checked the values of each array at the same index to show if matching bracket exists. if the bracket length were unequal than the automatically returned false.
