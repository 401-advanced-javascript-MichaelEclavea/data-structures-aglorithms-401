# Insertion Sort

- First we create a function that takes in a parameter of an array.
- Create a for loop that index's the first index of that array and stop the loop at the length of that array. 
- create another for loop at the second index of that array. 
- compare the 1st index and the second index of the for loops run logic. 
- if index b < index a, then swap index[b] to index[a] and repeat this process to you get to the end.
