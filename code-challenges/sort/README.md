## Challenge Description
take an array and sort it from smallest to largest. 

## Approach & Efficiency
My approach was to follow the logic on the psedocode. This was a lengthier process than i would have done it myself. I wrote out a simple sort function and a reverse sort function as well. The efficiency on those codes were easier.
